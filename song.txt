Livin' easy
Lovin' free
Season ticket on a one-way ride

Askin' nothin'
Leave me be
Takin' everything in my stride

Don't need reason
Don't need rhyme
Ain't nothin' I'd rather do

Goin' down
Party time
My friends are gonna be there too, yeah

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell

No stop signs
Speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
